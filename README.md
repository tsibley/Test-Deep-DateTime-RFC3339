# NAME

Test::Deep::DateTime::RFC3339 - Test RFC3339 timestamps are within a certain tolerance

# SYNOPSIS

    use Test::Deep;
    use Test::Deep::DateTime::RFC3339;

    my $now    = DateTime->now;
    my $record = create_record(...);
    cmp_deeply $record, { created => datetime_rfc3339($now, '5s') },
        'Created is within 5 seconds of current time';

# DESCRIPTION

Test::Deep::DateTime::RFC3339 provides a single function, [`datetime_rfc3339` ](https://metacpan.org/pod/&#x20;#datetime_rfc3339), which is used with [Test::Deep](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::Deep) to
check that the **string** value gotten is an RFC3339-compliant timestamp.  It
can also check if the timestamp is equal to, or within optional tolerances of,
an expected timestamp.

[RFC3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) was chosen because it is a sane
subset of [ISO8601's kitchen-sink](https://metacpan.org/pod/DateTime::Format::ISO8601#Supported-via-parse_datetime).

# FUNCTIONS

## datetime\_rfc3339

Without arguments, the value is only checked to be a parseable RFC3339
timestamp.

Otherwise, this function takes a [DateTime](https://metacpan.org/pod/DateTime) object or an
[RFC3339 timestamp](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) string parseable by
[DateTime::Format::RFC3339](https://metacpan.org/pod/DateTime::Format::RFC3339) as the required first argument and a
[DateTime::Duration](https://metacpan.org/pod/DateTime::Duration) object or a [DateTime::Format::Duration::DurationString](https://metacpan.org/pod/DateTime::Format::Duration::DurationString)-style
string (e.g. `5s`, `1h 5m`, `2d`) representing a duration as an optional
second argument.  The second argument is used as a Â± tolerance centered on the
expected datetime.  If a tolerance is provided, the timestamp being tested must
fall within the closed interval for the test to pass.  Otherwise, the timestamp
being tested must match the expected datetime.

All comparisons and date math are done in UTC, as advised by
["How-DateTime-Math-Works" in DateTime](https://metacpan.org/pod/DateTime#How-DateTime-Math-Works).  If this causes problems for you, please
tell me about it via bug-Test-Deep-DateTime-RFC3339 _at_ rt.cpan.org.

Returns a Test::Deep::DateTime::RFC3339 object, which is a [Test::Deep::Cmp](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::Deep::Cmp),
but you shouldn't need to care about those internals.  You can, however, reuse
the returned object if desired.

Exported by default.
